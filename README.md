# R2DS-Essentials
*name not final*

Bunch of essentials modules for any self-respecting Dedicated Server.

Intended to work for vanilla clients, although obviously other mods you have installed may invalidate this.

## Modules

### Steamnames
  Makes the users appear with their actual steamnames instead of `[unknown]`.
  
### MotD
  Adds a configurable message of the day that is send to clients when they connect.
  
## Planned features

* interactible console
* ??? it's like half a day since coming up with this
