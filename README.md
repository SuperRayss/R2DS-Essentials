# R2DS-Essentials
*name not final*

Bunch of essentials modules for any self-respecting Dedicated Server.

Intended to work for vanilla clients, although obviously other mods you have installed may invalidate this.

If you want an usable console window : Put the start_server.bat in the same folder as the regular game executable and use it to launch your dedicated server

## Modules

### ExecConfig
	This module is only useful if you use the start_server.bat ! Execute the server config file of your choice located in `Risk of Rain 2_Data/Config/` (server.cfg by default).

### MotD
	Adds a configurable message of the day that is send to clients when they connect.

### RetrieveUsername
	Makes the users appear with their actual steam nickname instead of `[unknown]`.
  
## Planned features

* Interactible Server Console to execute commands directly from the console window.
